# Robotic-Interactive-Computing-System-RICS-
Senior Capstone project with EECS 498 Section 9 at the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor

The purpose of this project is to create a program to control an Arduino-powered MeArm to assist our client with certain everyday tasks. The arm is controllable through both a desktop and a voice application. The desktop app was developed using the Qt software. The basis for the voice application is the open-source [SpeechRegonition program](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition), which is routed through the Google Cloud Speech API.

All code for the desktop application is found within the "Alpha2" folder.
All code for controlling the Arduino is found within the "RICS ARM" folder.
All code for the voice application is found within the "speech_recognition" folder on the "voice" branch.
